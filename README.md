These are just a few example programs for the [Terasic DE0 Board](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=56&No=364).

Blink just blinks the first LED.

Counter uses all 10 LEDs and counts up to 1023

Toggle makes all the LEDs blink but only if the corresponding switch is on.

vga puts some colors on the screen.
